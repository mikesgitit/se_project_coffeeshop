This webpage utilitzes various functions that enhance the user interface for an engaging experience.

I utilized animations to make the landing page more interactive with the navigation and social media links. Additionally, there are aesthetic animation changes in the background design, as per the project requirements. Embeded links were also used which allows the user easy access to informational demos related to the company or service the page is designed for. Another function that was employed were lists. Styling the lists I found to be something that could be improved upon or expanded upon for further user engagement. Perhaps a hover effect or animation to expand as the user explores the page could make the experience more memorable and effective from a marketing perspective.

I would also have included more detailed information on the products this coffee shop used. There could be an expose on how and where the coffee is acquired, techniques in roasting, or maybe an initiative that supports global coffee trade and how the customer is playing a role in supporting coffee farms by shopping at the Triple Ten Coffee shop.

Additionally, the embed links could have been styled with a bit more care and aesthetic to make them pop. Maybe even animations to reveal the video links if a user was interested.

Overall I really enjoyed this project and found my knowledge being tested and applied in a real world way that makes me feel very excited to continue learning and extending my skills as a software engineer.
